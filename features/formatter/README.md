# Formatter

This feature provides a standard configuration for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), an opinionated code formatter.

## Features

- **singleQuote**: Prefer single quotes over double quotes.
- **trailingComma**: Include trailing commas where valid in ES5 (objects, arrays, etc.).
- **printWidth**: Set to 80 characters for better readability.

## Usage

To integrate this configuration into your project, add the `.prettierrc` file to your project root.

If using the project CLI, this feature will be merged into any existing Prettier configuration during setup.
